This is a demo application using Python, QT, Tensorflow to be run on embedded devices for Crowd counting. It is based on the following paper:

Single-Image Crowd Counting via\n Multi-Column Convolutional Neural Network, Zhan et al., CVPR IEEE, 2016

## 1. Requirements

List of python dependencies are in the requirements.txt
Demo requires a camera for live mode


## 2. Running the application

To run the application, simply run the main_app.py from the directory where this file is located

## 3. How-to

There are two modes of operation available:

1. Offline mode (press 'o' to switch to this mode) - using pre-sampled images of crowds

2. Live mode (press 'l' to switch to this mode) - using camera feed with opencv

3. Additionally, press 'ESC' to quit the application at any time.
