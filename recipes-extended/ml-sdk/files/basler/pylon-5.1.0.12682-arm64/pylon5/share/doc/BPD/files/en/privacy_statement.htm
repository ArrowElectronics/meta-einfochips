<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
<h2>Data Protection Declaration</h2>
<p>Dear User,</p>
<p>We thank you for your interest in our company, our products, and our 
 information.</p>
<p>The protection of your private sphere in the use of the Basler Product 
 Documentation is an important issue for us. For this reason we are in 
 agreement with the applicable legal regulations for the protection of 
 personal information and data security.</p>
<p>Data processing takes place in compliance with the following principles:</p>
<h3>Cookie Tracking</h3>
<p>Cookies are small text files that are stored by your browser when you 
 visit some websites and use applications. You can define how websites 
 use cookies by configuring the privacy settings in your browser (additional 
 information on cookie settings can be found in the help function of your 
 browser). If you deactivate cookies entirely, then websites of the Basler 
 Product Documentation may under some circumstances not work properly.</p>
<h3>Google Analytics</h3>
<p>Google Analytics, the web analysis service from Google Inc. (&quot;Google&quot;), 
 is used on the Basler Product Documentation. Google Analytics uses cookies 
 to allow for an analysis of usage of the Basler Product Documentation.</p>
<p>The information obtained by the cookies about the use of the Basler Product Documentation 
 is generally transfered to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>
<p>The IP anonymization is activated for the Basler Product Documentation 
 in order to guarantee the anonymous recording of IP addresses. Your IP 
 address is then abbreviated by Google before being transfered within the 
 member states of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement 
 on the European Economic Area. The complete IP address is abbreviated 
 and transfered to a server in the USA only in exceptional cases.</p>
<p>On behalf of Basler AG, Google will use this information to evaluate 
 your use of the Basler Product Documentation, to compile reports about 
 website activity, and to provide further information about the website 
 use and the services connected to Internet use with respect to Basler 
 AG. The information may be transmitted by Google to third parties where 
 legally permitted or third parties are processing that data on behalf 
 of Google.</p>
<p>On behalf of Basler AG, Google and third party providers will place 
 Basler advertisements on the internet. The data collected by Google Analytics 
 are used to place those ads.</p>
<p>You can prevent Google Analytics from capturing data by clicking on 
 the following link. An opt-out cookie is then set that prevents the future 
 recording of your data when visiting this site.</p>
<p><a href="" id="disableGa">Click here to opt-out from Google Analytics</a>.</p>
<p id="gaDisabled">Google Analytics opt-out is active.</p>
<p><a href="https://privacy.google.com/">Further information about Google 
 Analytics and data protection can be found here.</a></p>
<h3>Forms &amp; E-Mails</h3>
<p>Personally relevant data which is entered into a form or via e-mail 
 on the Basler Product Documentation is thereby used to establish contact 
 with you and to provide you with the requested information.</p>
<p>As an international company, all of our companies are thereby instructed 
 to the greatest extent possible to have the same type of information. 
 For this reason we transmit customer information to our subsidiaries and 
 distributors in individual cases as necessary. In this regard then, there 
 is no transmission of personal information to third parties.</p>
<h3>Your Rights as the User</h3>
<p>According to § 34 and § 35 of the German Federal Data Protection Law, 
 as the user you (&quot;affected person&quot;) have the right to demand 
 information at any time about which data has been saved by us and for 
 what reason this has been saved. You may furthermore report incorrect 
 data or have such data deleted which is invalidly stored or no longer 
 required.</p>
<h3>Data Protection Requests</h3>
<p>Our external operational data protection officer is responsible for 
 the compliance and monitoring of our data protection obligations. He is 
 also available to you for further information at any time regarding data 
 protection.</p>
