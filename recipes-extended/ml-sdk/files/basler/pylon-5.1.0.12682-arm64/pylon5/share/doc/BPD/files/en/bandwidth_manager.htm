<p class="teaser">The Bandwidth Manager of the <a href="overview_of_the_pylon_viewer.htm">pylon 
 Viewer</a> lets you analyze your system in order to achieve optimum performance 
 when working with more than one camera.</p>
<p>The Bandwidth Manager is available in the Windows and Linux version

<p>When connecting more than one camera to a single PC, performance can 
 become an issue as the cameras compete against each other for the available 
 bandwidth. To avoid such conflicts, use the Bandwidth Manager. It shows 
 you the following information at a glance:</p>
<ul>
	<li>USB 3.0 host controller and GigE network adapters installed on 
	 your system and the cameras connected to them</li>
	<li>Total bandwidth available (approximately) per USB 3.0 host controller</li>
	<li>Amount of data sent by the camera and received by the PC</li>
	<li>Frames per second (fps) sent by the camera and received by the 
	 PC</li>
	<li>Total number of images taken</li>
	<li>Number of transmission errors, i.e., incomplete and skipped images</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this information, you can use the Bandwidth Manager to optimize 
 the bandwidth consumption of the cameras connected.</p>
<h2><a name="MiniTOCBookMark2"></a>Overview of the Bandwidth Manager</h2>
<p>The <span class="gui-text">Bandwidth Manager</span> dialog lists all 
 USB 3.0 host controllers and GigE network adapters in your PC as well 
 as the cameras connected to each of them. It allows you to allocate a 
 share of the total bandwidth available on the USB 3.0 host controller 
 or network adapter to each camera. This way, you can allocate only so 
 much bandwidth to a camera as it actually needs, thus freeing up resources 
 for other devices.</p>
<p>For USB 3.0 cameras, the <span class="gui-text">Bandwidth (MB/s)</span> 
 column also lists how much bandwidth is available on the USB 3.0 host 
 controller to which the cameras are connected. This is an approximate 
 value of the maximum bandwidth available.</p>
<p>For GigE cameras, there is an <span class="gui-text">Optimize</span> 
 button for each network adapter. You can click this button to optimize 
 the bandwidth of all selected cameras on this network adapter. You have 
 to select at least one camera for the button to become active. If you 
 have GigE cameras connected to your PC and open the Bandwidth Manager 
 for the first time, a dialog opens that allows you to optimize all GigE 
 cameras in a single step.<br />
The optimization involves adjusting the <span class="gui-text">Packet Size</span> 
 and <span class="gui-text">Inter-Packet Delay</span> settings. If more 
 than one camera is connected to a network adapter, e.g., via a switch, 
 the available bandwidth is shared across all selected cameras.</p>
<p>Clicking the <span class="gui-text">Configure Camera</span> button <img src="images/icon_configure_camera.png" alt="Configure Camera icon" title="Configure Camera icon" width="18" height="18" border="0" /> 
 opens the <span class="gui-text">Features</span> tree of the pylon Viewer 
 where you can change camera settings.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>The following screenshot shows two cameras. The acA2500-14uc, by design, 
 achieves a frame rate of 14 frames per second. For this, a bandwidth of 
 approximately 70 MB/s is sufficient. However, an acA640-120gc can deliver 
 up to 120 frames per second and would therefore consume more bandwidth.</p>
<p>This is a simplified analogy. In practice, other camera settings influence 
 the bandwidth consumption as well, e.g., size of the AOI, pixel format 
 etc.</p>

<h2><a name="MiniTOCBookMark3"></a>Optimizing Bandwidth Consumption</h2>
<p>To optimize the performance of your system you start by analyzing the 
 current situation. Once you have an overview, you can try to fine-tune 
 the bandwidth consumption. You can change the bandwidth allocated to each 
 camera on the fly, making it really easy to find the perfect balance between 
 several devices.</p>
<p><strong>To optimize bandwidth consumption:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Stop continuous image acquisition as well as any recordings on 
	 the cameras you want to analyze.</li>
	<li>Open the Bandwidth Manager.</li>
	<li>Select the cameras whose bandwidth you want to analyze.</li>
	<li>Click <span class="gui-text">Start Analysis</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indented-1">The columns to the right of the camera get populated 
 with data. In the <span class="gui-text">Images</span> column, you can 
 see the total number of images taken. If there are any images that haven't 
 been transmitted completely or have been skipped entirely, they are listed 
 in the <span class="gui-text">Errors</span> column.</p>
<p class="indented-1">While the analysis is running, you can change the 
 bandwidth available to a certain camera by using the spin box or the slider 
 next to it. You will immediately see the effect of your changes in the 
 data displayed.</p>
<p class="info">The bandwidth value is the upper limit available to a camera, 
 which it can't exceed. Therefore, if the camera is not utilizing the full 
 amount of bandwidth, changing the bandwidth will have no visible effects. 
 Only if you lower it so much that the camera can't achieve its frame rate 
 anymore, will you see how the values for <span class="gui-text">Payload 
 Received (MB/s)</span> drop. Note that the payload value is usually lower 
 than the available bandwidth because any overhead sent at the same time 
 is not included.</p>
<ol start="5">
	<li>Once you are happy with the results, click <span class="gui-text">Stop 
	 Analysis</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indented-1">The Bandwidth Manager dialog will display the current 
 bandwidth for the selected camera. You can take a note of it for use in 
 other applications.</p>
<p class="indented-1">Instead of stopping the analysis manually, you can 
 select the <span class="gui-text">Stop analysis after</span> option and 
 specify a period of time after which the analysis is stopped automatically. 
 This is useful if you want to gather data over a longer period of time.</p>
<p class="info">In the <span class="gui-text">Bandwidth Manager</span> 
 dialog, the bandwidth is given in MB/s for improved readability. On USB 
 3.0 cameras, this value corresponds to the <span class="gui-text">Device 
 Link Throughput Limit</span> value in the <span class="gui-text">Device 
 Control</span> category which is given in B/s. For GigE cameras, this 
 value corresponds to the <span class="gui-text">Device Current Throughput</span> 
 value in the <span class="gui-text">Device Transport Layer</span> category 
 which is also given in B/s.</p>
<ol start="6">
	<li>Optional: Save the current camera settings to a user set if you 
	 want to preserve them. Otherwise, if you disconnect the cameras, you 
	 will have to repeat the bandwidth configuration.</li>
